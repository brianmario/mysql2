 * times away from a zone transition, without the varargs dispatch,
 * per-argument boxing, and repeated offset search of the funcall path.
 *
 * The mechanism is offset-guess-and-verify built on localtime_r alone:
 * mktime is deliberately not used (it re-derives the zone state on every
 * call and measures slower than the entire funcall path it would replace,
 * where localtime_r reads cached zone data). The wall clock becomes a
 * UTC-shaped epoch via days_from_civil; subtracting the zone offset gives a
 * candidate instant, and one localtime_r round-trip proves or refutes it.
 * On a wrong guess the probe's own tm_gmtoff supplies the correction, and
 * one more round-trip settles it.
 *
 * Correctness near transitions is handled by refusal, not resolution. A
 * result is served only when the zone offset is provably constant at five
 * probes spaced MYSQL2_LOCAL_PROBE_STEP apart across [t - span, t + span],
 * and t additionally sits at least MYSQL2_LOCAL_SERVE_MARGIN inside the
 * proven band. The margin is what makes an ambiguous wall time
 * unservable: serving the wrong side of a fall-back fold requires a
 * transition within one fold-width of t, and the margin covers the
 * largest backward step in any zone's [1970, 2038) history (7 hours,
 * Antarctica/Vostok 1994; next largest 3) four times over. The probe
 * spacing makes the refusal sound for any zone whose transitions sit more
 * than one step apart -- all of tzdata and every implicit-rule TZ string.
 * Explicit-rule TZ strings (a comma in the value) never prime a band at
 * all, because their ,start,end tail is the one user-reachable syntax
 * that can place a canceling fold/gap pair between adjacent probes, where
 * no finite sampling can detect it -- densifying the probes cannot fix
 * that, so those zones simply keep the funcall. Near any detected
 * transition the caller likewise falls back to Time.local,
 * byte-identical with the funcall path.
 *
 * Serving is also bounded to wall-clock years [1970, 2038), because
 * outside that range Ruby and the C library disagree in some zones even
 * away from transitions: below it tzdata answers in seconds-precision
 * Local Mean Time while Ruby maps through a congruent modern year (year
 * 1000 in Denver: four seconds apart), and from 2038 the two interpret a
 * zone's post-table extension rule differently (America/Nuuk 2038-04-15:
 * -01:00 to Ruby, -02:00 to libc). Both sides are internally consistent,
 * so no round-trip can arbitrate; the funcall owns both tails.
 *
 * Proven bands -- their ranges, offsets, and the TZ environment value
 * each was proven under -- are memoized on the result wrapper, two of
 * them so a result whose datetime columns live in different eras (a
 * drifted created_at/updated_at pair) keeps both proofs alive instead of
 * re-proving on every row. Datetime values cluster within a column, so
 * in the common case each cell costs one localtime_r plus a band check
 * over at most two candidates, and concurrently iterated results keep
 * independent proofs. The cache is written under the GVL (this path
 * never releases it). Serving compares the live TZ string against the
 * band's memoized copy -- never pointers, because setenv can reuse the
 * same allocation for a new value, and offset equality alone cannot
 * distinguish two zones that share an offset but disagree inside a fold.
 * A changed TZ re-routes into re-proving; staleness costs probes, never
 * a wrong answer. A result whose consecutive cells outrun the bands
 * entirely retires to the funcall for its remainder.
 *
 * The remaining Qnil cases mirror mysql2_utc_time: an epoch outside
 * time_t, an out-of-range subsecond, plus a TZ value too long to memoize. */
